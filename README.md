Different characters have a unique set of stats, [skills](https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) starter [weapons](https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons) (see table below). Some characters can be purchased using in-game [gems](https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/Gems)<br>

## **Characters as NPCs**

Each character has something to say when the player interacts with them.

They also have normal properties like the player; such as can be affected with [Burn](https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/Burn), healed and shielded by the Priestess, etc. Most of these would just occur in the Living Room, however.<br>

If the player has unlocked other characters, a character different from the player's (different from all in [Multiplayer](https://soul-knight.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer) mode) may also appear at the starting room of each floor, as an NPC during a run (except Legendary Heroes). Talking to that character will cause something to happen, depending on the character the player is talking to. Some may even follow the player and attack enemies for the rest of the current floor.

 All character NPCs (except legendary characters) are found in the upper left area of the first room in every level, next to the place where Vending Machines would appear, but cannot be found in Boss Rush Mode.
